# Final Project
### Database

All the files obtained for the project are located in the folder.

* Some files contain the data created to visualize what the team expected from the real database, those files with data were called mock data.

* The team found a database called heart.csv, used also as mock data.

* The real data came from Kardias Foundation, can be seen also in the folder.

* Other extra csv files were created from the original databases.
