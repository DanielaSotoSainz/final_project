# Final Project
### Pediatric Cardiopathies from ABC Hospital (Mexico City)

### Source Data: 
Kardias Foundation ABC Hospital

We aim to work with Kardias Foundation. This will allow us to work with real data and a real client.
Kardias has a specialized program in the care of children born with congenital heart disease in two hospitals: the National Institute of Pediatrics (INP) and the ABC-Kardias Pediatric Heart Center (in partnership with the ABC Medical Center). This program is committed to excellence, so it shares the best practices with the most important pediatric heart centers in the world and has the most advanced technology to perform surgeries of the highest complexity and quality.

## Team Members

* Galo Cázares Fernández - Architect 

* Alberto Valdez Quinto - Audio Engineer

* Daniela Soto Sainz - Biomedical Engineer

## Team Strategies

The creation of a team required different tools to archive a project successfully. In this case, the interdisciplinary team proposed some strategies to create a productive environment during the process and the presentation of the project.

Communication:
It is important to always be in touch with each member of the team. All the team needs to know what is going on and what is going to happen before each class, including the rubrics for each deliverable. The technologies that the team is going to use are Whatsapp and Slack.

Organization:
The team will require a great organization to feel comfortable during the project. After each reunion, the team will generate a minute with the tasks made and the ones that each team member has to do before the next reunion. Also, each team member has its own role and all the team is aware of the responsibilities of each role.

## Guidance:
In each interdisciplinary team, it is known that each member has different strengths and weaknesses. The team talked at the beginning of the project about their skills in data analytics and knowledge of the topic. All the members proposed to ask if it is required. It is important to recognize that some difficulties and doubts will appear during the process and asking for help will be necessary. 

## Team Members Roles:
* Square: Dany

“The team member in the square role will be responsible for the repository.”

* Circle: Galo

“The member in the circle role will create a mockup of a database with a set of sample data, or even fabricated data. This will ensure the database will work seamlessly with the rest of the project.”

* Triangle: Beto

“The member in the triangle role will create a mockup of a machine learning model. This can even be a diagram that explains how it will work concurrently with the rest of the project steps.”

## Exploratory Data Analysis:

## Technologies:
* Data Analysis: Excel, Python, Pandas
* Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, K-means
* Database: PostgreSQL, PgAdmin
* Visualization: Tableau, GeoJSON, Plotly
* API: Python, Flask

*Reasons why we selected the topic*

The team wants to work on the medical field, as all members have gained experience on the field recently. The team wanted to engage with real clients and real data, so we contacted Kardias Foundation, which is part of ABC Medical Center since 2012. Kardias has formalized an academic agreement in 2014 with The Texas Children's Hospital, considered the best center for congenital heart disease care in the United States, and which has contributed to maintaining excellence in the care of patients. Kardias has kept mortality and morbidity rates comparable to the best centers in the world and has sorted the most complex heart problems. The surgery team has performed more than 10,000 consultations and more than 3,000 surgeries since 2001, It is the only program in Mexico with medical-surgical results audited thanks to participation in the "International Quality Improvement Collaborative (IQIC)", administered by Boston Children's Hospital.

All the members want to work with predictive models that help Kardias inner medical circle to understand data and visualize it, so it can be used as a decision making tool. Kardias foundation constantly receives donations, so final reports would be useful to be shared with donors.
